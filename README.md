# fnxgamejam-haunted-mansion
A Spooky Adventure  for the Foenix256 computer, written as part of the October 2024 Game Jam

## The Pitch
Haunted Mansion - Walking home after a party, a sudden thunderstorm builds up and starts pouring rain on you.  You have to duck under the stoop of a beautiful old mansion to keep dry, but then notice the door is open.  Stepping inside to ask the owners if you can wait out the downpour, the door suddenly shuts behind you locking you inside! 

You must find the key to open that door in order to leave the house!  Explore 9 rooms! Solve puzzles to progress!  Maybe avoid a ghost or something if I have time!  Perhaps be entertained!

Can I write Haunted Mansion in two days?  And if I do... can you escape it?  ðŸ‘»
